              <span class="para-colour-change">Innovation and Creativity</span>:
              Evaluate the uniqueness and creativity of the solution. Consider
              whether it addresses a real-world problem in a novel way or
              introduces innovative features.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="para-colour-change">Functionality</span>: Assess how
              well the solution works. Does it perform its intended functions
              effectively and without major issues? Judges would consider the
              completeness and robustness of the solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="para-colour-change">Impact and Relevance</span>:
              Determine the potential impact of the solution in the real world.
              Does it address a significant problem, and is it relevant to the
              target audience? Judges would assess the potential social,
              economic, or environmental benefits.
